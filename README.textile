h1. Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) Helper Library

This helper library provides a similar interface as Google's deprecated "GCMRegistrar":http://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gcm/GCMRegistrar.html class, but uses Google's new "GoogleCloudMessaging":http://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/gcm/GoogleCloudMessaging.html API instead.
